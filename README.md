# OOPs_Lab_BT_CS_405-

This repository will have all the programs written by me as a part of our Object Oriented Programming in C++ course in our college under the mentorship of Dr. Anant Sir

### List of Programs:

- Write a program to read a matrix of size mxn from the keyboard and display the name using function
- Program to make the use of inline function
- Write a function power() which raise a number m to a number n. The function takes double value of m and integer value of n and returns the result. Use a default value of n is 2 to make the function to calculatesquares when this argument when n is omitted.
