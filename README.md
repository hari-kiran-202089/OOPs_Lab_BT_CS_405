# OOPs_Lab_BT_CS_405-

This repository will have all the programs written by me as a part of our Object Oriented Programming in C++ course in our college under the mentorship of Dr. Anant Sir

### List of Programs:

1. Write a program to read a matrix of size mxn from the keyboard and display the name using function

2. Program to make the use of inline function

3. Write a function power() which raise a number m to a number n. The function takes double value of m and integer value of n and returns the result. Use a default value of n is 2 to make the function to calculatesquares when this argument when n is omitted.
4. Write a program to show that the effect of default arguments can alternatively achievied by overloading

5. Write a class ACCOUNT that represents your bank account and then use it. The class should allow you to i) Deposit money, ii) Withdraw money iii) Calculate interest and send you a message if have insufficient balance

6. Write a STRING class that can be used to store string, add strings, equate strings, output strings
7. Create a class TIME to store time in hours and minutes. Write a friend function to add two TIME objects.

8. Create two classes DM and DB. DM stores the distance in meters and centimeters and DB stores the distance in feet and inches. write a program to add object of DM with object of DB classe

9. Write a program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method number of sides(). Provide three classes named Trapezoid, Triangle and Hexagon such that each of the classes contains only the method number of Sides() that shows the number of sides in the given Geometrical figure

10. Program to demonstarte the concept of
    - Default Constructor
    - Parametrized Constructor
    - Copy Constructor
    - Constructor Overloading
11. Program to demonstrate the concept of destructor
12. Program to show multiple inheritance
13. Program to show multilevel inheritance
14. Program to show hybrid inheritance
15. Program to show the concept of containership
16. Unary Operator Overloading
17. Binary Operator Overloading
18. Program to show runtime polymorphism using virtual function
19. Program to work with formatted and unformatted I/O operations
20. Program to read the name and roll number of students from keyboar and write them into a file then display it
21. Program to copy content of one file onto the end of another, adding line numbers
22. Write a funciton template for finding the minimum value contained in an array.
